# postrust-auth

JWT authentication and role resolution for Postrust.

- Verifies JWTs (plain or base64 secrets) and extracts claims.
- Resolves the PostgreSQL role for a request, falling back to the anonymous role.
- Passes claims through as GUCs so row-level security policies can read them.

## Install

```bash
cargo add postrust-auth
```
